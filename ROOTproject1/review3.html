    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">The aesthetic of this website speaks volumes on its content without needing to say anything. It is a high tech collage homepage presentation for select locations in Shibuya, Tokyo. It feels cool to look at, I could spend a considerable amount of time staring and interacting with the homepage. This website effortlessly pushes its content to the viewer. And seeing that the <i>art</i> section is crossed out makes me genuinely feel like I've missed out on an eventful day in Shibuya.</p>


    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">Althought this website is very praisewrothy, there are some evident faults to it. The lesser of the two evils I found is that the ligebility of the written content is very hard to read because it is hidden by the shifting background, such as the above-page tabs, or that the same shifting and layered background distracts from the main paragraph bodies. The greater evil seen in this website is that it is not too demographic friendly. While I love the <i>glitched</i> aesthetic, anyone from an older demographic may find it hard to follow or very alienating. Also anyone with photosensitivity or reading difficulties may find it hard to navigate and to look at.</p>
