    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">I have fallen in love. This webstie gets straight to the point. All the information I need is not only there, but is visually striking and well presented. I adore the orange and white pallette, a tried and true combination. It is so well advertised within its own website, with all the animations and general designed resembling those of Apple and all the advanced information at the bottom is very user friendly. It is seriously pushing the <i>modbile</i> aspect of the product with all the phone motifs, their animations and the Apple Store and Google Play downloads links posted both at the beginning and end of the site.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">The only negative I have about the website is that instead of posting how many positive reviews and rating they have on the App Stores and other rating websites, they limit themselves to four reviews made by users. Having user reviews is not bad by itself, but it is a bit too limited when they already mention the one million happy users. Show me the data that proves how much they enjoy the service. I love seeing stars and x/5 ratings, it solidifies the product as a high end and well developped service without the need to write little to any words. I guess it might give them a 'desperate' look, but there is a reason as to why almost everyone advertises their App rating: it is an effective way to convey a good look to potential customers. When looking for an App to download, out of many who play in the same field, we almost always go for the one with the highest user rating. Showing this would elminate the potential user from peaking at other products in the first place when browing the App store as they would already be reassured of quality.</p>
