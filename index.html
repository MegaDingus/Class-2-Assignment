    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">My first impression of the website is that it has beautiful art and text composition. Then everything flops to the ground when you scroll down; all the text becomes spaced out and thrown at all corners of the screen. After a beautiful slide presentation, they hit me again with another demonstration of how they misuse their space in combination with icredible small text. It feels like they asked for a modern website with an inviting allure to it, but forgot to budget anything but the animations.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">Please, I urge you to scroll all the way down to their Socials section and tell me why they pushed all their most important contact infortmation to the sides and leave the center of the page empty. Another thing is the haunting 'Need Help?' button that permanently follows me throughout my adventure of this gray website.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">Beyond the animations, which I wish to learn how to make, it looks like all the assets were found on Google Slides or something. I know that it's going for a <i>barebones</i> and <i>modern</i> look to it, but it falls so short and makes their website look stunted. It really feels like the higherups of the company stopped funding the site midway through.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">Almost all the pictures are clickable and send you directly to their product, basically rearing us to buy it at a misclick's notice. All the infortmation provided, at least what's legible, acctually brings up important facts about the product they're selling.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px;">I don't know what gray they used for the background color, but I absolutely love it. It might be the most consistent thing in the website. And my final note is that viewing the website on a mobile format, it clearly was designed to be originally viewed that way, with all the empty spaces shortenning, but still somewhat present, and becoming easier on the eyes.</p>
